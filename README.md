# Basic User Login Register System

* This project represents a login/register system that uses a .txt file to store the user's informations.
* Every user in "Users" class has a username, password, year and level information. These "Users" are stored in a list named "user_list" and this list is used to control login action.
* New user can register with above informations and they would be stored in the .txt file for later login.
